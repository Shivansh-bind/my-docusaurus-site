    Objectivity – no bias.

    Experimentation – controlled testing.

    Replicability – repeatable results.

    Verifiability – results can be checked.

✨ Unit I Recap

    Psychology = study of behavior & mental processes.

    Wundt founded first psychology lab in 1879.

    Goals = Description, Explanation, Prediction, Control.

    Psychology is a science → Objectivity, Experimentation, Replicability, Verifiability.

    Scientific Method = Question → Hypothesis → Test → Conclusion → Report.

Think of psychology as a compass 🧭 — it helps us describe, explain, predict, and sometimes even control human behavior.
